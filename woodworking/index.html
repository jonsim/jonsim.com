        Outside of work, one of my hobbies is woodworking. I particularly enjoy
        the contrast to my day-job and I find it an effective way to unwind
        while also channeling my passion for making.
      </p>
      <p>
        I almost exclusively use hand-tools. This is mostly because I enjoy the
        process and the connection with the piece it builds, knowing that it was
        made purely from my own energy. Practical reasons also play a concern:
        I have nowhere to put a band saw, table saw, planer, router, mill or
        lathe.

        The larger projects I have undertaken are listed here.

      <b>Finished:</b> August 2018<br/>
      <b>Description:</b> The under-stairs drawers were my first sizeable
        carpentry project. It took me a year start-to-finish, however it spent
        months at a time parked waiting for me to find enthusiasm to continue
        it - it probably would have taken about 10 consecutive weeks (of
        evenings and weekends).<br/>
        I learned a lot doing it - most of all not to assume any surface is
        parallel or perpendicular to any other when dealing with house
        frames!<br/>
        I started by knocking out the wall underneath my stairs, which was
        previously a very impractical cupboard accessible only from behind. In
        the resulting void I constructed a frame for the drawers to run in and
        built it into the studs I had revealed when I removed the wall. I
        ensured the frame had sufficient horizontal supports to attach the
        drawer runners to later.<br/>
        Next I lined the frame with plywood to hide the frame when the drawers
        were extended. This was easier said than done - the drawer voids were
        all 1m deep and none of them were comfortable spaces for an adult. I
        then faced the front of the frame to bring it flush with the outer
        stringer. This mostly finished the frame.<br/>
        For the drawers, I started by making the fronts out of oak. This was
        more time-consuming than it should have been as they were all different
        sizes, lacked right-angles (a result of tying the drawer frame to that
        of the house) and needed tapering to ensure a flush look when closed.
        Having made the fronts, I constructed the bodies out of 12mm plywood,
        butt-jointed, glued and screwed together. Not a fancy work of joinery,
        but they were large drawers and I knew I was going to paint them. These
        went together fairly quickly, and then received several coats of paint.
        They all have notches at the rear as the corridor they will extend into
        isn't actually wide enough to simply slide them in, so they have to be
        dropped and rotated in - which the notches allow (and turned out to be
        an interesting mathematical solution to calculate the correct size and
        position).<br/>
        Finally I fitted the soft-close, push-to-open full-extension runners
        (the longest I could find at 700mm), using 3 per drawer for the
        triangular drawers and 4 for the rectangular one. This ensured they were
        strong enough to handle being fully loaded. To the same end I also
        reinforced the drawers with vertical bearers. The downside of using
        multiple runners per drawer is obviously that they must be aligned
        perfectly, and I spent 12-hours fine-tuning all the runners to ensure
        each drawer closed smoothly and the push-to-open worked (and had enough
        space behind the front to push into).<br/>
        I'm really pleased with the result - I love how it looks, and it has
        massively increased how accessible that storage space is.<br/>

      <b>Finished:</b> January 2019<br/>
      <b>Description:</b> I made this blackboard as a birthday gift for my
        parents when they failed to find something of adequate quality which
        would fit in their kitchen - the best they could find was a poor
        quality blackboard from Amazon with some of the worst mitres I've ever
        seen (unforgivable when mass-produced by machine).<br/>
        To make it I bought a cheap LUNS blackboard from IKEA, which I liked as
        chalk adhered to it well and it was magnetic. I then carefully extracted
        the blackboard surface (and turned the frame into kindling) and cut it
        to the desired size. Next I created a frame out of oak, joined with
        half-lap mites all around, ploughed a &#8539; groove in all of them and
        cut a key-hole mounting mechanism. Finally I added a shelf for chalk
        before finishing with shellac.<br/>
        The entire project took me two weeks.<br/>

      </div>
      <b>Finished:</b> May 2018<br/>
      <b>Description:</b> My desk is made from 4 solid oak boards, laminated
        together. Each board was 225 x 38 mm and 1.8m long. The desk is 1.7m
        wide, 87cm deep and 74cm high. Being solid oak it is exceptionally
        solid. I contracted a steel-works in Cornwall to make the legs, which
        are standard 80 x 40 mm box-section steel welded into a rectangle and
        simply clear-coated to preserve their industrial appearance. The top is
        finished in Polyurethane to stand up to daily use.<br/>
        The entire project only took me 1 weekend, plus evenings of the
        subsequent week to apply finish. I'm really happy with how it turned
        out and I ensured I placed the most figured board at the front to give
        the desk character.<br/>

      <b>Finished:</b> April 2018<br/>
      <b>Description:</b> Made from 15, 4m long red-wood 2x4s this was my first
        large project. It was made to a Paul Sellers design, modified to measure
        5ft x 3ft, with a well in the center. It also has two shelves between
        the legs to add storage and even more weight (it weighs 130kg unladen).
        It's outfitted with a 10&#189;-inch quick-release vice, mounted on the
        left-hand end to make the most of the space in the workshop (despite me
        being right-handed).<br/>
        I really enjoyed making this - pine is a lovely material to work with,
        and converting a stack of 2x4s into a large piece of furniture was
        exceptionally rewarding. It was a particularly challenging project as
        I did it just using a Black &amp; Decker workmate.<br/>
        The project took me 5 months start to finish, although there were
        significant pauses during that time. I also had to start-over as it
        emerged the first batch of 2x4s were far too warped to be useable and
        couldn't be laminated straight. Cutting my losses and restarting was
        gutting, but the right call.
