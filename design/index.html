        One of my passions is graphical design. I get to practice this in a
        professional capacity as, in addition to being a Software Engineer, I
        also design the icons we use in our tools. This is a job I greatly enjoy
        as both a break from coding and a creative outlet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work I enjoy 3D modeling and rendering. I am for the most
        part self-taught, although I also took relevant modules in my degree
        where possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        For image creation and editing I mostly use Photoshop, although I am
        currently learning GIMP as an alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
        For 3D modelling, my older creations used
        <a href="http://www.wings3d.com" target="_blank">Wings3D</a>
        for both modeling and texturing, a package I strongly recommend for
        anyone starting out. I have since moved on to using Maya for both
        purposes. I have used a variety of rendering packages: the majority of
        my recent models have been rendered with metal ray, while my older
        creations were rendered with
        <a href="http://www.kerkythea.net/" target="_blank">Kerkythea</a>.

      <b>Description:</b> This is a project I started in August 2013 and have
          been working on intermittently ever since. The project's aim is to
          model a 1934 Riley Ulster Imp, a rare sports car typical of the prewar
          era: a historical period I find fascinating (as further evidenced by
          the 1934 motorcycle I have also created).
          I have mostly finished the modelling, although some of the bodywork
          needs cleaning up and rivets/screw heads need adding. Once this is
          complete the model will need texturing. My ultimate aim is to texture
          both this and the motorcycle so I may create a scene containing the
          pair of them.<br/>

      <b>Description:</b> This was created in the 3rd year of my degree as part
          of a Character and Set Design unit and I achieved the highest mark in
          the year for the model. The assignment was to visit the
          <a href="http://mshed.org/" target="_blank">M Shed</a>, a local
          modern-history museum, and choose an exhibit to reproduce. I chose a
          motorcycle which I later found out to be a 1934 600cc Douglas OW1,
          1 of 8 remaining in the world. Due to its rarity no blueprints or
          other reference images were available, so I took plenty of
          photographs and sketched an orthographic, side-on view from these to
          use as reference. The assignment was to create a raw model, as we
          hadn't been taught how to apply textures/materials, hence the lack of
          colour. This is one of my favourite projects and I'm exceptionally
          pleased with how it turned out. I intend one day to finish it off by
          texturing and properly rendering it.<br/>

      <b>Description:</b> This character was created in the 3rd year of my
          degree as part of a Character and Set Design course. I received the
          third highest mark in the year for the character. The specification
          was to create a robotic character (or Olympoid) for the 2040 Olympics,
          when it was posited that robots would be taking part in place of
          humans and a single robot would be required to compete in all the
          games. My robot was designed to represent Greece and took influence
          from the Greek gladiators that would have taken part in the ancient
          Olympic Games. I'm not 100% happy with the result and believe I could
          have done better, however I had to rush the final stages, hence the
          compromises. I may go back to this model at a later date and finish
          it properly. The texturing in particular could be improved by adding
          some appropriate damage/wear and fixing the tearing issues visible in
          places.<br/>


      <h1>'Primitives' Short</h1>

      <b>Finished:</b> 30-Nov-2012<br/>
      <b>Description:</b> This short was put together for a project I did in
          the 4th year of my degree as part of an Animation Production unit.
          I obtained the second highest mark in the year for the result. The
          specification was to have many smaller objects come together to form
          a larger object or character. Created in Maya (with a small amount
          of post production in After Effects) my short took a somewhat unique
          twist on the assignment and, rather than bringing many identical or
          almost identical objects together into a character or creating a
          character and breaking it apart, I bring together many objects from a
          more natural environment. My intention with this was to keep a much
          greater sense of suspense running throughout the short, as well as
          giving the final character some personality. This is probably one of
          the largest and most ambitious projects I have undertaken with the
          entire short being single handedly created from scratch in three weeks
          while also managing other deadlines.<br/>

      <b>Finished:</b> 24-Jan-2013<br/>
      <b>Description:</b> This short was put together for a project I did in the
          4th year of my degree as part of the Animation Production unit. The
          specification was to have a character which you downloaded from the
          internet perform a dance routine to a song of your choice. Created in
          Maya, rendered in mentalray and composited in After Effects, my
          project brought a statue to life rather than a more conventional human
          character, dancing to Michael Jackson's Smooth Criminal. The statue
          model was downloaded from
          <a href="http://thefree3dmodels.com/stuff/architecture/lenin_statue/11-1-0-1405" target="_blank">here</a>,
          and the island model (a small portion of which is used as a backdrop)
          was downloaded from
          <a href="http://thefree3dmodels.com/stuff/architecture/island_with_a_village/11-1-0-1219" target="_blank">here</a>.
          I achieved the highest mark in the year for the short.<br/>
