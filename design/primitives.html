      <h1 class="first">'Primitives' Short: Deconstruction</h1>
      On this page I break down the individual items used in the 'Primitives'
      short, along with details of their construction.
      
      <h1>The Set</h1>
      <img class="full_width" src="images/primitives_set.jpg"/>
      <p>
        The set is designed to look like the interior of an ageing shed. The
        wooden boards making up the walls, roof and floor are all simple cuboids
        which have been (dis)placed by hand. Ideally I would have liked to add
        displacement maps to these to make them look slightly more beaten up and
        less perfect, but I was able to texture them to appear antiquated. Five
        different diffuse maps are used for the boards making up the walls and
        ceiling to avoid obvious repetition.
      </p>
      <p>
        The workbench was one of the more challenging models to make as I knew
        it would feature in numerous close-ups from different angles. I wanted
        to give it an old and beaten-up look, something I achieved using Maya's
        sculpting tool which, while not perfect (especially around angular
        edges) and quite slow to work with, did a good job of achieving the
        desired effect. This effect was continued to both legs (the thicker
        one and the thinner legs which are all the same model, just rotated
        different amounts). In order to texture the table I baked out a
        displacement map relative to the original cuboid shape, giving a mask
        of the areas that had been weathered away. This was used to make the
        exposed wood a different colour and texture. An AO map was also baked
        out to give an idea of where grime would collect on the surface; taking
        special care to make the points the legs connected look realistic.
        Various paint splatters and dust markings were finally added to give
        the table some history.

        <h1 class="column">Butterfly</h1>
        <img class="full_width" src="images/primitives_butterfly.jpg"/>
        <p>
          The butterfly, which acts as the initiator for the story arc in the
          short, was modelled with NURBS to create a complex and flexible wing
          shape. The central body (which needed to be little more than a
          cylinder since it was never seen in closeup) had a small amount of fur
          applied to it to break up the otherwise unnaturally clean lines. The
          animation rig for the butterfly was one of the most complex made for
          the short in order to achieve a realistic flight motion: ensuring the
          different parts of the butterfly's wings moved correctly. Sadly, while
          the flapping animation was near perfect, the actual movement the
          butterfly executed was not as realistic as I would have liked.

        <h1 class="column">Caliper</h1>
        <img class="full_width" src="images/primitives_caliper.jpg" />
        <p>
          Based on a pair of medical calipers (probably one of the more tenuous
          items to naturally occur in a garden shed), the calipers act as the
          creature's ribs and are variously resized to appear anatomically correct.
